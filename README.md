I am currently a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Sogang University, supervised by Prof. Junsuk Choe. Prior to this, I obtained my M.S. Degree in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Sogang University advised by the same supervisor. Previously, I received a B.S. Degree at the same university.

**Research Interests**: I research how to make open-vocabulary dense prediction models, such as segmentation and object detection, more scalable. My focus is on enabling visual grounding models to perform lifelong learning. In addition, I explore how to scale dense prediction models using imperfect datasets, such as self-supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and few-shot learning.

My recent primary research question is **how to develop scalable and sustainable segmentation models through lifelong learning.**
